# OpenMixBoard

OpenMixBoard is an open-source toolkit for building collaborative audio experiences. It combines the flexibility of a digital DJ mixing console with real-time sharing features, enabling musicians, hobbyists, and event hosts to co-create playlists, experiment with live looping, and broadcast sessions to their communities.

## Why OpenMixBoard?
- **Open hardware compatibility**: Works with MIDI controllers, DIY Arduino builds, or purely software-based setups.
- **Collaborative playlists**: Multiple participants can curate tracks simultaneously, vote on upcoming songs, and hand off control seamlessly.
- **Live performance ready**: Low-latency audio routing, configurable effects racks, and snapshot-based presets keep performances smooth.
- **Extensible**: Expose custom modules through Python or JavaScript plugins to automate workflows or integrate external services.

## Core Components
1. **Mixer Engine** – Provides multi-channel routing, EQ, compression, and send effects.
2. **Deck Interface** – Visual decks for track manipulation, beat syncing, and cue management.
3. **Collaboration Hub** – Real-time chat, voting, and shared crate management for remote contributors.
4. **Automation Layer** – Scriptable triggers for lights, visuals, or hardware controllers.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Connect your preferred audio interface or MIDI controller.
3. Launch the dashboard to configure decks, audio routing, and collaboration rooms.
4. Share invite links with collaborators to start co-mixing instantly.

## Roadmap
- Enhanced session recording with stem separation.
- WebRTC-based low-latency streaming for remote jam sessions.
- Mobile companion app for quick cueing and monitoring.

OpenMixBoard welcomes community contributions—whether feature ideas, bug reports, or new plugin modules. Dive in, remix, and share your sound.
